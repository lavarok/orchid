<h3>Get some OXT</h3>
<p>You need OXT tokens to pay network providers for bandwidth. Most users need $10 USD worth of OXT
  for 1 month of usage and a $2 deposit.</p>
<p>Remember: You only pay for the bandwidth you use and the deposit is refundable.</p>

<h3>Set up a Web3 enabled wallet</h3>
<p>Orchid does not use a standard email and password for authentication. Instead, you use a web3-enabled
  Ethereum wallet. You will want to have the Ethereum address of the wallet handy for when you
  setup the app. If you have a wallet already  setup, then you can skip to step 3.</p>
<p>Here are the steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Setup a Web3 enabled wallet, such as <a href="https://wallet.coinbase.com/">Coinbase Wallet</a>,
  <a href="https://trustwallet.com/">Trust Wallet</a> or <a href="https://metamask.io/">Metamask</a></li>
  <li>Once in the wallet, find the Ethereum wallet address to receive funds and copy it to your clipboard</li>
  <li>Switch over to where your OXT is stored</li>
  <li>Send your OXT to the Ethereum address</li>
  <li>Send $1-2 of ETH to the Ethereum address for "gas"
  (<a href="https://media.consensys.net/ethereum-gas-fuel-and-fees-3333e17fe1dc">learn more</a>)</li>
</ol>

<h3>Configure the Orchid app</h3>
<p>The Orchid app is where you manage your private path to the Internet by constructing custom
  "hops" on our new VPN platform. To fund your hops, you will need to connect them to your funding
  source via your Orchid account.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Tap the "+" button to create a new hop</li>
  <li>Tap "Orchid Hop" to create a hop on the Orchid Network</li>
  <li>Paste your wallet address (from Step 2) into the "Wallet address" field</li>
  <li>To the right of the "Signer key" field, tap the "+" icon to create a new signer key for your
  hop (You will want to use a unique key for each hop to ensure privacy)</li>
  <li>Tap the "Generate key" button and then tap "Save" in the top right</li>
  <li>Now you have a hop! Tap on the "Copy" button to copy your signer key to the clipboard for
  Step 4 so you can fund that hop.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Create and fund an Orchid account</h3>
<p>Your gateway to funding Orchid is found at <a href="https://account.orchid.technology/">account.orchid.technology</a>.
  Here, funds can be transferred between your wallet and Orchid. This would include topping off your
  funds when they run low, setting up the account to get started, and removing the funds at any time.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to create and fund your Orchid account:</p>
<ol>
  <li>In the wallet, find the dapp browser and tap on it</li>
  <li>Type in account.orchid.technology (bookmark this page to find it again easily)</li>
  <li>Click on the button to fund your account</li>
  <li>Here there are three fields to fill in. The signer key comes from the Orchid app</li>
  <li>Fill in $10 USD wrth of OXT into the balance and $2 USD worth of OXT in the deposit</li>
  <li>Now you need your signer key from the app</li>
</ol>
<p>You now have a funded hop!</p>
